# Multi-agent simulations

CS course project for multiagent simulations with `gym` :

`single_agent_simulation.ipynb` shows first iteration without multiagent feature. Contains environment generator and training stage.
Introduces extensible definition of actor's behavior with custom actions, reward outcomes and general constrains (e.g. life span)

`multiagent_simulation.ipynb` is extended with reproduction by division

`real_multiagent.ipynb` introduces interactions with other actors for reproduction

--- 

`symulacje` folder contains footages of executed simulations for final iteration

Root folder gifs are some valuable simulation cases from previous development stages
